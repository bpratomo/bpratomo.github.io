Believer of solving the world's problem through effective synergies of business and technology. Passionate about programming, data science, and infusing them to the inner workings of a company. 

Started as a data-driven Internal Process Improvement Consultant for a construction company, I experienced first hand the excitements of crafting the future by leveraging technology to enable your businesses. 

This convinces me to learn as much as I can about both business and technology. Thus, I pursued and completed an MBA degree all the while picking up Python and machine learning. 



Quick breakdown of my tooling knowledge to indicate where I can pursue my passion in infusing technology in the inner workings of a company (this list will continue to expand):


- Database Administration: SQL Server, SQLite, PostgreSQL

- Web Development: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Flask, Django, React

- Web Scraping with Python

- Business Automation: Blue Prism, UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Python scripting for automation, Microsoft Office VBA

- Cloud: Microsoft Azure
